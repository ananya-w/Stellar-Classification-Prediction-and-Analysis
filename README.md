# Stellar-Classification-Prediction-and-Analysis
Our project employs ML algorithms to classify celestial objects using SDSS DR17 data. Achieving 97% accuracy, we enhance astrophysical research with efficient spectral dataset analysis using Random Forest algorithm.

## Overview
This repository houses the code and documentation for a research project focused on stellar classification and analysis in astronomy. Leveraging data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 17 (SDSS DR17), we employ machine learning algorithms to classify celestial objects such as stars, galaxies, and quasars.

## Key Features
-Utilizes SDSS DR17 data for stellar classification.
-Implements various machine learning algorithms for classification.
-Achieves 97% accuracy in categorizing celestial objects.
-Identifies Random Forest as the optimal model with 98% accuracy.
-Enhances astrophysical research through efficient spectral dataset analysis.

## Technologies Used
-Python
-Scikit-Learn
-Jupyter Notebooks
